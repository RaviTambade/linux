# Shell scripting in Linux

Shell scripting in Linux is the process of creating and executing a series of commands in a shell or command-line environment.  It involves writing Linux shell scripts or a series of commands in a text file using a scripting language that is interpreted by the shell. The aim is to automate tasks or perform repetitive tasks quickly and efficiently. The shell program is the default for many Linux distributions.

- With shell scripting, users can automate tasks such as managing files, configuring system settings, and managing processes.
- Users can also build custom applications or tools that extend the functionality of the operating system.
- Conditional tests in shell scripting allow users to proceed with massive data amounts, files to store and read data, and variables to store and read data, and these scripts may contain functions.
- Shell scripting is done using one of several scripting languages supported by the shell, including Bash, Zsh, and Korn shell.
- These scripting languages are designed to be simple and easy to learn, and they provide a wide range of interactive features and functionality for writing powerful shell scripts.

## Linux Shell scripts
Shell scripts are programs written in Bash that can be executed from the command line. Shell scripts can automate tasks such as backups, system maintenance, and software installations. Also, Bash command names are case-sensitive and can be combined with options and arguments to perform specific actions.

Linux shell scripts can be executed in several ways, including running the script directly from the command line, using the shell's built-in scheduler to run the script at specified intervals, or calling the script from another script or program.

for example: 
### #!/bin/sh


### Advantages  Of Shell Scripting	                
 -Shell scripting allows users to automate complex or repetitive tasks, saving time and reducing the risk of errors.
- They can be customized to meet specific needs and can be modified easily to accommodate changing requirements.
- Shell scripts can be run on any system that supports the same shell and scripting language, making them highly portable.
- Also, Linux shell scripts can be integrated with other tools and applications to provide a complete solution for managing and automating Linux systems.

### Disadvantages Of Shell Scripting	       
- Shell scripts can become difficult to maintain over time, especially as they grow in complexity. As it is not fully recursive, it may lead to a limit in complex command handling.
- They can pose a security risk if not written and executed correctly, leading to costly errors and design flaws.
- Debugging Linux shell scripts can be difficult, especially for complex scripts and conditional commands involving multiple commands and functions.
- They are not suitable for all types of tasks which have some conditional commands and special variables.


### What Is Shell Prompt?
A shell prompt is a special character or symbol that appears on the command line of a shell, indicating that the shell is ready to accept input from the user. The prompt has an interactive interface and typically consists of a user identifier and the name of the current working directory, followed by a command line special character or symbol, such as a dollar sign ($), the hash symbol (#), or the percent sign (%). The syntax is similar to other programming languages & it provides a visual indication of the shell's status to help users navigate the file system and execute commands efficiently.
